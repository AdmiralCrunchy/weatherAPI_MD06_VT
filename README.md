# weatherAPI_MD06_VT

## Details

This was the 6th assignment module for the UW boot camp program that went over server-side APIs . The assignment tasks me with retrieving data from another application's API and use it give weather predictions for the end user. Using this information to build a dashboard that will run on the browser and feature dynamically updating HTML and CSS. Making use of the OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve the information for cities.

## Confidence

---

This was one of the harder assignments to come back to after being off the subject for a while. But I am glad that I came back to do it, refreshed myself on the subject and feel that I got stronger on the other aspects that I didn't quite understand the first time around.
