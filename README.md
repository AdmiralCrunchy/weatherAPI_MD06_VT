# weatherAPI_MD06_VT
This was the 6th assignment module for the UW boot camp program that went over server-side APIs . The assignment tasks me with retrieving data from another application's API and use it give weather predictions for the end user. Using this information to build a dashboard that will run on the browser and feature dynamically updating HTML and CSS. Making use of the OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve the information for cities.
